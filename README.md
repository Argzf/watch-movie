watch-movie is a web app for watching movies easily. Check it out at **[watch.gzf.cool](https://watch.gzf.cool)**.

This service works by displaying video files from third-party providers inside an intuitive and aesthetic user interface.

Features include:

- üïë Saving of your progress so you can come back to a video at any time!
- üîñ Bookmarks to keep track of videos you would like to watch.
- üéûÔ∏è Easy switching between seasons and episodes for a TV series; binge away!
- ‚úñÔ∏è Supports multiple types of content including movies, TV shows and Anime (coming soon‚Ñ¢Ô∏è)

## Goals of watch-movie

- No ads
- No BS: just a search bar and a video player
- No responsibility on the hoster, no databases or api's hosted by us, just a static site

## Self-hosting

A simple guide has been written to assist in hosting your own instance of movie-web.

Check it out here: [https://github.com/Argzf/watch-movie/blob/dev/SELFHOSTING.md](https://github.com/Argzf/watch-movie/blob/dev/SELFHOSTING.md)
